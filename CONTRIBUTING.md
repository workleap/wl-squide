## Monorepo setup

This repository is managed as a monorepo with [PNPM workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to handle the installation of the npm dependencies and manage the packages interdependencies.

It's important to note that PNPM workspace doesn't hoist the npm dependencies at the root of the workspace as most package manager does. Instead, it uses an advanced [symlinked node_modules structure](https://pnpm.io/symlinked-node-modules-structure). This means that you'll find a `node_modules` directory inside the packages folders as well as at the root of the repository.

The main difference to account for is that the `devDependencies` must now be installed locally in every package `package.json` file rather than in the root `package.json` file.

## Project overview

This project is split into two major sections, [packages/](packages/) and [sample/](sample/).

### Packages

Under [packages/](packages/) are the actual packages composing the federated application shell.

[@squide/core](packages/core/) is a package including the core functionalities of the shell, like the runtime and the messaging infrastructure. The shell architecture is very similar to an [hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)), whereas the ports are mostly what constitutes the core package.

[@squide/react-router](packages/react-router/) is a [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) implementation of the shell routing capabilities. This implementation is offered as a standalone package because the shell could eventually support alternative routing libraries like [TanStack router](https://tanstack.com/router/v1).

[@squide/webpack-module-federation](packages/webpack-module-federation/) is module federation implementation for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/). This implementation is offered as a standalone package because not all application configurations will require module federation and the shell could eventually support alternative module federation application like [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/).

[@squide/fakes](packages/fakes/) is a collection of fake implementations to facilitate the development of federated modules in isolation.

### Sample

Under [sample/](sample/) is a sample application to test the federation application shell functionalities while developing.

In this sample application would find:

- [An host application](sample/host/): http://locahost:8080
- [A static module](sample/static-module/)
- [A remote module](sample/remote-module/): http://localhost:8081

## Installation

This project uses PNPM, therefore, you must [install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation):

To install the project, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Develop the shell packages

We recommend opening two [VSCode terminals](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics#_managing-multiple-terminals) to develop the shell packages.

With the first terminal, execute the following script:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

With the second terminal, execute the following script:

```bash
pnpm dev-sample
```

You can then open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to get a live preview of your code. To test that the remote module is working correctly, navigate to `http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js`

## Release the packages

When you are ready to release the packages, you must follow the following steps:
1. Run `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompt. For versioning, always follow the [SemVer standard](https://semver.org/).
2. Commit the newly generated file in your branch and submit a new Pull Request(PR). Changesets will automatically detect the changes and post a message in your pull request telling you that once the PR closes, the versions will be released.
3. Find someone to review your PR.
4. Merge the Pull request into `main`. A GitHub action will automatically trigger and update the version of the packages and publish them to [npm]https://www.npmjs.com/). A tag will also be created on GitHub tagging your PR merge commit.

### Troubleshooting

#### Github

Make sure you're Git is clean (No pending changes).

#### npm

Make sure GitHub Action has **write access** to the selected npm packages.

#### Compilation

If the packages failed to compile, it's easier to debug without executing the full release flow every time. To do so, instead, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

By default, packages compilation output will be in their respective *dist* directory.

#### Linting errors

If you got linting error, most of the time, they can be fixed automatically using `eslint . --fix`, if not, follow the report provided by `pnpm lint`.

## Deploy the sample application

The sample application is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 2 sites are available, one for the host application (https://squide-host.netlify.app/) and one for the remote module application (https://squide-remote-module.netlify.app).

To deploy both websites, open a terminal at the root of the repository and execute the following script:

```bash
deploy-sample
```

It will automatically deploy both sites to production.

## Commands

From the project root, you have access to many commands the main ones are:

### dev

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### dev-sample

Build the sample application for development and start the dev servers.

```bash
pnpm dev-sample
```

### dev-docs

```bash
pnpm dev-docs
```

### build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### build-sample

```

### clean

```bash
pnpm clean
```

### reset

```bash
pnpm reset
```

### list-outdated-deps

```bash
pnpm list-outdated-deps
```

### update-outdated-deps

Updated outdate dependencies to their latest version. For more information, view [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/cli/update).

```

## CI

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for this repository.

You can find the configuration in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows/) folder and the build results available [here](https://github.com/workleap/wl-squide/actions).

We currently have 2 builds configured:

### Changesets

This build runs on a push on the `main` branch, and if theirs a file present in the `.changeset` folder, will publish the new package version on npm.

### CI

This build will trigger when a commit is done in a PR to `main` or after a push to `main` and will run `build`, `lint-ci` and `test` commands on the source code.

## Add a new package to the monorepo

There are a few steps to add new packages to the monorepo.

Before you add a new package, please read the [GSoft GitHub guidelines](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/github-guidelines#npm-package-name).

### Create the package

First, create a new folder matching the package name in the [packages](/packages) folder.

Open a terminal, navigate to the newly created folder, and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm init
```

Answer the CLI questions.

Once the `package.json` file is generated, please read again the [GSoft GitHub guidelines](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/github-guidelines#npm-package-name) and make sure the package name, author and license are valid.

Don't forget to add the [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes) `"@squide"` before the package name. For example, if the project name is "foo", your package name should be `@squide/foo`.

Make sure the package publish access is *public* by adding the following to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

### sideEffects

Make sure to add a `sideEffect` field to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
    "sideEffects": false
}
```

Most of the time, the value will be `false` but if your package contains CSS or any other [side effect](https://sgom.es/posts/2020-06-15-everything-you-never-wanted-to-know-about-side-effects/), make sure to set the value accordingly.

### Dependencies

npm *dependencies* and *peerDependencies* must be added to the package own *package.json* file.
